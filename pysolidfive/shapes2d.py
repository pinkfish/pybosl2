    """A lazy 2-D shape: a symbolic signed-distance function of (x, y) plus bounds -- the flat
    sibling of PyShape, for building lid-pattern shapes (shapes.py/tesselations.py) entirely in
    SDF-land. Compose with translate/rotate/scale/mirror, the boolean operators, and the two
    ops SDFs do BETTER than polygon math: offset() (a single subtraction -- exact, rounded,
    no self-intersection cleanup) and outline() (|d| - w/2, the centered outline strip).

    A 2-D SDF can't be meshed directly (frep() is 3-D only), so a PyShape2D turns into real
    geometry by extruding: extrude(height) / linear_extrude(height=...) return a PyShape (with
    the same optional rim roundover/flare treatments as polygon_prism()); anything else a
    PyShape2D doesn't define falls through __getattr__ to a thin (0.01) extrusion's mesh --
    which is almost never what you want, so extrude explicitly.
