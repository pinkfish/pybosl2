    frep() needs and (for cuboid-shaped instances) enough metadata to add more edge
    treatments after the fact.

    Extra controls beyond a bare `frep()` call:
      - Lazy, cached meshing: the real PythonSCAD/libfive C extension is only touched by
        .mesh() (or by falling through __getattr__ to a real method like .show()/.color()),
        so a chain of edits never re-meshes early.
      - translate(v): shifts the SDF itself (`f(p) -> f(p - v)`), exact and free -- no
        meshing involved -- and keeps chamfer()/round() working correctly afterwards by
        tracking where the cuboid's own local origin currently sits.
      - Boolean composition with another PyShape (`|` union, `&` intersection, `-`
        difference) via min()/max()/negate on the two SDFs directly, cheaper and more
        exact than meshing both shapes first and doing mesh-level CSG.
      - round(radius, edges=, except_edges=) / chamfer(size, edges=, except_edges=):
        add more edge treatment to an existing cuboid-shaped PyShape. Because this
        intersects (max()) the requested treatment into the *current* SDF rather than
        rebuilding from scratch, edges can be built up incrementally with different
        treatments -- e.g. `cuboid(size).round(2, edges="Z").chamfer(1, edges=[TOP+LEFT])`
        -- which a single bosl2.shapes3d.cuboid() call can't do (rounding/chamfer are
        mutually exclusive there, one radius for the whole call).

    CAVEAT: like bosl2.shapes3d.Bosl2Solid, this is a plain Python wrapper (composition),
    not a subclass of the real native PyOpenSCAD type. round()/chamfer() additionally only
    make sense for cuboid-shaped instances (built by cuboid(), or by a prior round()/
    chamfer() call on one) -- they assert if `cuboid_size` isn't set, the same restriction
    Bosl2Solid places on its own edge/corner masking methods.

    Because no closed-form SDF exists for the hull of arbitrary SDFs, the hull is polyhedral,
    built like convex_polyhedron(): each PyShape child is meshed (once, lazily -- the first
    .sdf()/.mesh()/native fall-through on the RESULT triggers it; constructing the hull is
    free), its mesh vertices are pooled with any raw points given, the pool is decimated to
    at most `directions` support points (see _support_points()), and the SDF is the max of
    the supporting planes' half-space distances. Consequences worth knowing:

      - Corner-dominated children (cuboids, prisms) hull exactly; smooth children (spheres,
        cylinders) get a faceted hull whose fidelity is set by `directions` (default 64) --
        raise it for a finer hull, at O(directions^4) one-off plane-extraction cost.
      - Meshing the children costs the same as rendering them, so prefer hulling simple/
        low-res shapes; for the exact smooth hull of meshed solids, the native
        pythonscad hull() on already-meshed children remains the right tool.
      - Like every PyShape, the result composes symbolically (booleans, transforms) without
        re-meshing.
