class Bosl2Solid(Distributable, Colorable, Partitionable, Miscellaneous):
    """Wraps a PyOpenSCAD solid together with the geometry metadata (nominal `size` and
    `anchor`) that BOSL2's $parent_geom attachment system would otherwise track, so that
    edge/corner/face masking (bosl2/masking.py) work as plain chained methods instead of
    needing size=/anchor= threaded through by hand at every call site. Every function in this
    file returns an instance of this class (or a subclass).

    Every geometry method (translate/rotate/mirror/multmatrix/scale/color, the union/intersection/
    difference CSG operators) delegates to the wrapped native shape and returns a new Bosl2Solid carrying the
    same size/anchor metadata forward. Any other method not explicitly listed here (e.g.
    resize(), offset()) falls through via __getattr__ to the native shape and returns its raw,
    *unwrapped* result, since we can't know whether the size/anchor metadata still applies.

    Only cuboid()-shaped objects (cube(), cuboid() -- the only ones in this file with a genuine
    axis-aligned box `size`) support the masking methods; every other shape (prismoid, wedge,
    octahedron, the cylinder family, the sphere family) carries size=None and will assert if a
    masking method is called on it, since bosl2/masking.py's edge/corner positioning math only
    supports cuboid parents.

    CAVEAT: this is a plain Python wrapper (composition), not a subclass of the real native
    PyOpenSCAD C-extension type -- there was no way to verify from this environment whether
    that type even supports subclassing. Calling a method on a Bosl2Solid (`shape.translate(...)`,
    `shape.edge_profile(...)`) is safe. But if a Bosl2Solid is ever passed *directly* as a bare
    argument into a function that expects a native geometry object -- `hull(a, b)`,
    `minkowski(a, b)` -- rather than having a method called on it, the receiving function needs
    the raw native object: use `.shape` to unwrap explicitly.

    way cyl() is (native cylinder with fn=sides for the plain case; a revolved half-profile with
    fn=sides for chamfered/rounded ends), so it shares cyl()'s exact rim geometry.

    Sizing gives the CIRCUMradius (vertex distance) unless noted -- exactly one of ``radius``/``diameter``
    (radius/diameter to the vertices), ``ir``/``id`` (inradius/apothem to the face centers,
    converted via ``/cos(180/sides)``), or ``side`` (edge length, converted via ``/(2 sin(180/sides))``).
    ``radius1``/``radius2`` (or the corresponding taper) set the bottom/top radius independently for a frustum.

    Note: BOSL2 regular_prism()'s texture=/teardrop= options are not ported (they need the VNF
    texturing machinery this pure-Python port doesn't implement).

    Args:
        sides:        number of sides (integer >= 3)
        height/length/height/length: prism height (default 1)
        radius/diameter/ir/id/side:    overall size (see above)
        radius1/radius2:    bottom/top circumradius for a tapered prism
        chamfer/chamfer1/chamfer2:    end chamfer size (overall/bottom/top)
        rounding/rounding1/rounding2: end rounding radius (overall/bottom/top)
        circum:   circumscribe the nominal radius (scale by 1/cos(180/sides)) (default False)
        realign:  rotate by half a facet so a face, not a vertex, faces +X (default False)
        shift:    [X,Y] shift of the top center relative to the bottom center
        center:   if given, overrides anchor (True -> CENTER, False -> BOTTOM)
        anchor:   anchor point (default CENTER)
        spin:     Z-axis rotation in degrees after anchor (default 0)
