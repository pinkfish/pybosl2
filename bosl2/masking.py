# LibFile: bosl2/masking.py
#    Pure-Python port of the pieces of BOSL2's masks2d.scad/masks3d.scad/
#    attachments.scad "edge/corner/face profile" masking system that this
#    project uses: cutting a rounded profile along selected edges, corners,
#    or whole faces of a cuboid. No osuse()/BOSL2 runtime dependency.
#
#    BOSL2's real edge_mask()/edge_profile()/corner_profile() work through
#    its generic $parent_geom attachment-introspection system (so they can
#    run on any attachable shape) and position each edge mask using a
#    hardcoded Euler-angle table. This port only supports cuboid parents
#    (the only case this project uses -- every `body` passed in is a
#    shapes3d.cuboid() result), and takes the cuboid's `size=` explicitly
#    as a parameter instead of introspecting it. Edge/corner positioning is
#    derived directly from first principles (build an orthonormal local
#    frame at each edge/corner from the same EDGE_OFFSETS/CORNER_OFFSETS
#    vectors bosl2/shapes3d.py's cuboid() rounding already uses) rather
#    than replicating BOSL2's Euler-angle table.
#
#    corner_profile()'s local mask is also simplified: BOSL2 builds the
#    corner fillet by revolving the 2-D edge-rounding profile 90 degrees
#    around each axis. For mask2d_roundover() specifically (the only 2-D
#    mask this project ever uses), that construction is mathematically
#    equivalent to "a cube octant minus a sphere of the same radius" --
#    the same rounded-corner geometry cuboid()'s own `rounding=`
#    minkowski(cube, sphere) construction produces -- so that's what's
#    implemented here, without needing a general rotate_extrude of an
#    arbitrary 2-D profile.
#
#    edge_profile_asym() is used in this project only with its default
#    corner_type="none" and no flip=, in which case BOSL2's own
#    implementation degrades to calling edge_profile() per edge, so it's
#    just an alias here.
#
